# Front-end developer test

## Scenario

You're a front-end developer helping us out with a small task.

There's an important table of **recent appointments** in our software.  Unfortunately it's not great and needs some love.

Our designer has just finished some designs for this table and has produced some PSDs that we need implemented (they are in this repo).

The table needs to be responsive and accessible. There is a PSD for wide view and a PSD for narrow view too.

## What you should do

First, clone this repo (don't fork it).

You'll find an `index.html` in this repo, it has the current version of the table.

Improve the table in there so that it implements the designs in the PSDs (there are jpeg versions too).

## Limitations

There are very few. You can improve the current code or you can rewrite it.

You can use any technology you like for the HTML, CSS and Javascript.

It doesn't need to be a table, you can use any structure you think is appropriate

## Things to remember

It must be responsive.

We care a lot about accessibility.

Only good developers have been short-listed for this test.  Competition is tough.  Do a very good job.  Attention to detail matters.
